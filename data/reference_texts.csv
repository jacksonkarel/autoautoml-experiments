"BENT. 1. (From ""to bend""), primarily the result of bending; hence any
inclination from the straight, as in curved objects like a hook or a
bow; this survives in the modern phrase ""to follow one's own bent,"" i.e.
to pursue a certain course in a direction deviating from the normal, as
also in such phrases as Chaucer's ""Downward on a hill under a bent,""
indicating a hollow or declivity in the general configuration of the
land. From the bending of a bow comes the idea of tension, as in Hamlet,
""they fool me to the top of my bent,"" i.e. to the utmost of my capacity.
2. (From the O. Eng. _beonet_, a coarse, rushy grass growing in wet
places; cf. the Ger. _Binse_, a reed), the name (""bent"" or ""bennet"")
popularly applied to several kinds of grass and surviving in the form
""bent-grass."""
"George Bentham had neither a school nor a college education, but early
acquired the power of giving sustained and concentrated attention to any
subject that occupied him--one essential condition of the success he
attained as perhaps the greatest systematic botanist of the 19th
century. Another was his remarkable linguistic aptitude. At the age of
six to seven he could converse in French, German and Russian, and he
learnt Swedish during a short residence in Sweden when little older. At
the close of the war with France, the Benthams made a long tour through
that country, staying two years at Montauban, where Bentham studied
Hebrew and mathematics in the Protestant Theological School. They
eventually settled in the neighbourhood of Montpellier where Sir Samuel
purchased a large estate."
"When the last revise of the last sheet was returned to the printer, the
stimulus was withdrawn, and his powers seemed suddenly to fail him. He
began a brief autobiography, but the pen with which he had written his
two greatest works broke in his hand in the middle of a page. He
accepted the omen, laid aside the unfinished manuscript and patiently
awaited the not distant end. He died on the both of September 1884,
within a fortnight of his 84th birthday."
"Of his personal habits some anecdotes are related by his grandson,
Richard Cumberland, in vol. i. of his _Memoirs_ (1807). The hat of
formidable dimensions, which he always wore during reading to shade his
eyes, and his preference of port to claret (which he said ""would be port
if it could"") are traits embodied in Pope's caricature (_Dunciad_, b.
4), which bears in other respects little resemblance to the original. He
did not take up the habit of smoking till he was seventy. He held the
archdeaconry of Ely with two livings, but never obtained higher
preference in the church. He was offered the (then poor) bishopric of
Bristol but refused it, and being asked what preferment he would
consider worth his acceptance, replied, ""That which would leave him no
reason to wish for a removal."""
"Bentley was a source of inspiration to a following generation of
scholars. Himself, he sprang from the earth without forerunners, without
antecedents. Self-taught, he created his own science. It was his
misfortune that there was no contemporary gild of learning in England by
which his power could be measured, and his eccentricities checked. In
the _Phalaris_ controversy his academical adversaries had not sufficient
knowledge to know how absolute their defeat was. Garth's couplet--"
"BENUE, a river of West Africa, the largest and most important affluent
of the Niger (q.v.), which it joins after a course of over 800 m. in a
general east to west direction from its source in the mountains of
Adamawa. Through the Tuburi marshes there is a water connexion between
the Benue (Niger) and Shari (Lake Chad) systems."
"BEN VENUE, a mountain in south-west Perthshire, Scotland, 10 m. W. of
Callander. Its principal peaks are 2393 and 2386 ft. high, and, owing to
its position near the south-eastern shore of Loch Katrine, its imposing
contour is one of the most familiar features in the scenery of the
Trossachs, the mountain itself figuring prominently in _The Lady of the
Lake_. On its northern base, close to the lake, Sir Walter Scott placed
the Coir-nan-Uriskin, or ""Goblin's Cave."" Immediately to the south of
the cave is the dell called Beal(ach)-nam-Bo, or ""Cattle Pass,"" through
which were driven to the refuge of the Trossachs the herds lifted by the
Highland marauders in their excursions to the lands south of Loch
Lomond. The pass, though comparatively unvisited, offers the grandest
scenery in the district."
"BENZALDEHYDE (oil of bitter almonds), C6H5CHO, the simplest
representative of the aromatic aldehydes. It was first isolated in 1803
and was the subject of an important investigation by J. v. Liebigin 1837
(_Annalen_, 1837, 22, p. 1). It occurs naturally in the form of the
glucoside amygdalin (C20H27NO11), which is present in bitter almonds,
cherries, peaches and the leaves of the cherry laurel; and is obtained
from this substance by hydrolysis with dilute acids:"
"It occurs free in bitter almonds, being formed by an enzyme
decomposition of amygdalin (q.v.). It may also be prepared by oxidizing
benzyl alcohol with concentrated nitric acid; by distilling a mixture of
calcium benzoate and calcium formate; by the condensation of
chlor-oxalic ester with benzene in the presence of aluminium chloride,
the ester of the ketonic acid formed being then hydrolysed and the
resulting acid distilled:"
"Its addition compound with hydrocyanic acid gives mandelic acid
C6H5CH(OH)·COOH on hydrolysis; when heated with sodium succinate and
acetic anhydride, phenyl-iso-crotonic acid C6H5CH : CH·CH2COOH is
produced, which on boiling is converted into [alpha]-naphthol C10H7OH.
It can also be used for the synthesis of pyridine derivatives, since A.
Hantzsch has shown that aldehydes condense with aceto-acetic ester and
ammonia to produce the homologues of pyridine, thus:"
"On nitration it yields chiefly meta-nitro-benzaldehyde, crystallizing in
needles which melt at 58° C. The ortho-compound may be obtained by
oxidizing ortho-nitrocinnamic acid with alkaline potassium permanganate
in the presence of benzene; or from ortho-nitrobenzyl chloride by
condensing it with aniline, oxidizing the product so obtained to
ortho-nitrobenzylidine aniline, and then hydrolysing this compound with
an acid (_Farben fabrik d. Meister, Lucius und Brüning_). It
crystallizes in yellowish needles, which are volatile in steam and melt
at 46° C. It is used in the artificial production of indigo (see _German
Patent_ 19768)."
"Para-nitrobenzaldehyde crystallizes in prisms melting at 107° C. and is
prepared by the action of chromium oxychloride on para-nitrotoluene, or
by oxidizing para-nitrocinnamic acid. By the reduction of
ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde with ferrous sulphate and ammonia,
ortho-aminobenzaldehyde is obtained. This compound condenses in alkaline
solution with compounds containing the grouping -CH2-CO- to form
quinoline (q.v.) or its derivatives; thus, with acetaldehyde it forms
quinoline, and with acetone, [alpha]-methyl quinoline. With urea it
gives quinazolone"
"Benzene is a colourless, limpid, highly refracting liquid, having a
pleasing and characteristic odour. It may be solidified to rhombic
crystals which melt at 5.4° C. (Mansfield obtained perfectly pure
benzene by freezing a carefully fractionated sample.) It boils at 80.4°,
and the vapour is highly inflammable, the flame being extremely smoky.
Its specific gravity is 0.899 at 0° C. It is very slightly soluble in
water, more soluble in alcohol, and completely miscible with ether,
acetic acid and carbon disulphide. It is an excellent solvent for gums,
resins, fats, &c.; sulphur, phosphorus and iodine also dissolve in it.
It sometimes separates with crystals of a solute as ""benzene of
crystallization,"" as for example with triphenylmethane, thio-p-tolyl
urea, tropine, &c."
"Benzene is of exceptional importance commercially on account of the many
compounds derivable from it, which are exceedingly valuable in the arts.
Chemically it is one of the most interesting substances known, since it
is the parent of the enormous number of compounds styled the ""aromatic""
or ""benzenoid"" compounds. The constitution of the benzene ring, the
isomerism of its derivatives, and their syntheses from aliphatic or
open-chain compounds, are treated in the article CHEMISTRY. A summary of
its chemical transformations may be given here, and reference should be
made to the articles on the separate compounds for further details."
"Benzoic anhydride, (C6H5CO)2O, is prepared by the action of benzoyl
chloride on sodium benzoate, or by heating benzoyl chloride with
anhydrous oxalic acid (R. Anschütz, _Ann_. 1884, 226, p. 15). It
crystallizes in needles, melting at 42° C., and boiling at 360° C. It is
insoluble in water but readily soluble in alcohol and ether."
"Benzoyl chloride, C6H5COCl, is formed by distilling a mixture of
phosphorus pentachloride and benzoic acid; by the action of chlorine on
benzaldehyde, or by passing a stream of hydrochloric acid gas over a
mixture of benzoic acid and phosphorus pentoxide heated to 200° C. (C.
Friedel, _Ber._ 1869, 2, p. 80). It is a colourless liquid of very
unpleasant smell, which boils at 198° C., and solidifies in a freezing
mixture, the crystals obtained melting at -1° C. It shows all the
characteristic properties of an acid chloride."
"_Benzamide_, C6H5CONH2, is prepared by the action of benzoyl chloride on
ammonia or ammonium carbonate, or from ethyl benzoate and ammonia. It
crystallizes (from water) in glistening leaflets which melt at 130° C.
and boil at 288° C. Its silver salt behaves as if it were the salt of an
imido benzoic acid, since it yields benzimido ethyl ether
C6H5·C( : NH)·OC2H5 with ethyl iodide (J. Tafel and C. Enoch, _Berichte_,
1890, 23, p. 1550)."
"Chlor-, brom-, iodo- and fluor-benzoic acids are known and can be
obtained by oxidizing the corresponding halogen toluenes, or from the
amido acids, or by substitution. Nitration of benzoic acid gives chiefly
meta-nitro-benzoic acid. The ortho- and para-nitro-benzoic acids can be
obtained by oxidizing ortho-and para-nitro-cinnamic acids.
Ortho-amino-benzoic acid, C6H4·NH2·COOH (anthranilic acid), is closely
related to indigo (q.v.)."
"BENZYL ALCOHOL (PHENYL CARBINOL), C6H5CH2OH, occurs as a benzoic ester
in Peru balsam, as cinnamic ester in Tolu balsam, as acetic ester in
essential oil of jasmine, and also in storax. It may be synthetically
prepared by the reduction of benzoyl chloride; by the action of nitrous
acid on benzylamine; by boiling benzyl chloride with an aqueous solution
of potassium carbonate, or by the so-called ""Cannizzaro"" reaction, in
which benzaldehyde is shaken up with caustic potash, one half of the
aldehyde being oxidized to benzoic acid, and the other half reduced to
the alcohol. (_Berichte_, 1881, 14, p. 2394)."
"It is a colourless liquid, with a faint aromatic smell, and boils at
206° C. On oxidation with nitric acid it is converted into benzaldehyde,
whilst chromic acid oxidizes it to benzoic acid. Reduction by means of
hydriodic acid and phosphorus at 140° C. gives toluene, whilst on
distillation with alcoholic potash, toluene and benzoic acid are formed."
"BEOTHUK, a tribe of North American Indians formerly dwelling in the
interior of Newfoundland. A certain mystery attaches to them, since
investigation of the few words of their language which have survived
suggests that they were of distinct stock. The name (of Micmac origin)
is said to mean simply ""red men."" They were bitterly hostile to the
French settlers, and were hunted down and killed off until 1820, when a
few survivors made their escape into Labrador. The last of them is
believed to have died in 1829."
"BEOWULF. The epic of Beowulf, the most precious relic of Old English,
and, indeed, of all early Germanic literature, has come down to us in a
single MS., written about A.D. 1000, which contains also the Old English
poem of Judith, and is bound up with other MSS. in a volume in the
Cottonian collection now at the British Museum. The subject of the poem
is the exploits of Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow and nephew of Hygelac, king
of the ""Geatas,"" i.e. the people, called in Scandinavian records Gautar,
from whom a part of southern Sweden has received its present name
Götland."
"2. All fear being now removed, the Danish king and his followers pass
the night in Heorot, Beowulf and his comrades being lodged elsewhere.
The hall is invaded by Grendel's mother, who kills and carries off one
of the Danish nobles. Beowulf proceeds to the mere, and, armed with
sword and corslet, plunges into the water. In a vaulted chamber under
the waves, he fights with Grendel's mother, and kills her. In the vault
he finds the corpse of Grendel; he cuts off the head, and brings it back
in triumph."
"3. Richly rewarded by Hrothgar, Beowulf returns to his native land. He
is welcomed by Hygelac. and relates to him the story of his adventures,
with some details not contained in the former narrative. The king
bestows on him lands and honours, and during the reigns of Hygelac and
his son Heardred he is the greatest man in the kingdom. When Heardred is
killed in battle with the Swedes, Beowulf becomes king in his stead."
"5. The news of Beowulf's dear-bought victory is carried to the army.
Amid great lamentation, the hero's body is laid on the funeral pile and
consumed. The treasures of the dragon's hoard are buried with his ashes;
and when the great mound is finished, twelve of Beowulf's most famous
warriors ride around it, celebrating the praises of the bravest,
gentlest and most generous of kings."
"However detrimental these redundancies may be to the poetic beauty of
the epic, they add enormously to its interest for students of Germanic
history or legend. If the mass of traditions which it purports to
contain be genuine, the poem is of unique importance as a source of
knowledge respecting the early history of the peoples of northern
Germany and Scandinavia. But the value to be assigned to _Beowulf_ in
this respect can be determined only by ascertaining its probable date,
origin and manner of composition. The criticism of the Old English epic
has therefore for nearly a century been justly regarded as indispensable
to the investigation of Germanic antiquities."
"Eleven English translations of the poem have been published (see C.B.
  Tinker, _The Translations of Beowulf_, 1903). Among these may be
  mentioned those of J.M. Garnett (6th ed., 1900), a literal rendering
  in a metre imitating that of the original; J. Earle (1892) in prose;
  W. Morris (1895) in imitative metre, and almost unintelligibly
  archaistic in diction; and C.B. Tinker (1902) in prose."
"In the revolution of July he took no inconsiderable part. Copies of his
song, _Le Vieux Drapeau_, were served out to the insurgent crowd. He had
been for long the intimate friend and adviser of the leading men; and
during the decisive week his counsels went a good way towards shaping
the ultimate result. ""As for the republic, that dream of my whole life,""
he wrote in 1831, ""I did not wish it should be given to us a second time
unripe."" Louis Philippe, hearing how much the song-writer had done
towards his elevation, expressed a wish to see and speak with him; but
Béranger refused to present himself at court, and used his favour only
to ask a place for a friend, and a pension for Rouget de l'Isle, author
of the famous _Marseillaise_, who was now old and poor, and whom he had
been already succouring for five years."
"This condition of things was ended by Wellesley's victories at Assaye
and Argaon (1803), which forced the Bhonsla raja to cede his territories
west of the Wardha, Gawilgarh and Narnala. By the partition treaty of
Hyderabad (1804) these ceded territories in Berar were transferred to
the nizam, together with some tracts about Sindkhed and Jalna which had
been held by Sindhia. By a treaty of 1822, which extinguished the
Mahratta right to levy _chauth_, the Wardha river was fixed as the
eastern boundary of Berar, the Melghat and adjoining districts in the
plains being assigned to the nizam in exchange for the districts east of
the Wardha held by the peshwa."
"Under British control Berar rapidly recovered its prosperity. Thousands
of cultivators who had emigrated across the Wardha to the peshwa's
dominions, in order to escape the ruinous fiscal system of the nizam's
government, now returned; the American Civil War gave an immense
stimulus to the cotton trade; the laying of a line of railway across the
province provided yet further employment, and the people rapidly became
prosperous and contented."
"BERAT (Slav. _Byelgorod_; Turk. _Arnaut-Beligradi_), the capital of a
sanjak in the vilayet of Iannina, southern Albania, Turkey; on the river
Ergene, Ergeni or Osum, a left-hand tributary of the Semeni. Pop. (1900)
about 15,000. Berat is a fortified town, situated in a fertile valley,
which produces wine, olive-oil, fruit and grain. It is the see of an
Orthodox metropolitan, and the inhabitants, of whom two-thirds are
Albanian and the remainder principally Greek, are equally divided in
religion between Christianity and Islam."
"BERBERINE, C20H17NO4, an alkaloid occurring together with the alkaloids
oxyacanthine C18H19NO3, berbamine C18H19NO3, hydrastine C21H21NO6, and
canadine C20H21NO4, in _Berberis vulgaris_; it also occurs in other
plants, _Berberis aristata, B. aquifolium, Hydrastis canadensis_, &c. It
is a yellow, crystalline solid, insoluble in ether and chloroform,
soluble in 4½ parts of water at 21°, and moderately soluble in alcohol.
It is a monacid base; the hydrochloride, C20H17NO4·HCl, is insoluble in
cold alcohol, ether and chloroform, and soluble in 500 parts of water;
the acid sulphate, C20H17NO4·H2SO4 dissolves in about 100 parts of
water. Canadine is a tetrahydroberberine."
"Its constitution was worked out by W.H. Perkin (_J.C.S._, 1889, 55, p.
63; 1890, 57, p. 991). This followed from a study of the decomposition
products, there being obtained hemipinic acid (CH3O)2C6H2(COOH)2, and a
substance which proved to be [omega]-amino-ethyl-piperonyl carboxylic
acid, CH2O2:C6H2·COOH·CH2·CH2NH2. His formula was modified by Gadamer
(_Abs. J.C.S._, 1902, 1, p. 555), who made the free base an aldehyde,
but the salts of an _iso_-quinolinium type. This formula, which
necessitates the presence of two asymmetric carbon atoms in an alkyl
tetrahydroberberine, has been accepted by M. Freund and F. Mayer (_Abs.
J.C.S._, 1907, 1, p. 632), who showed that two racemic propyl
tetrahydroberberines are produced when propyl dihydroberberine is
reduced."

"BERCHEM (or BERGHEM), NICOLAAS (1620-1683), Dutch painter, was born at
Haarlem. He received instruction from his father (Pieter Claasz van
Haarlem) and from the painters Van Goyen, Jan Wils and Weenix. It is not
known why he called himself Berchem (or Berighem, and other variants).
His pictures, of which he produced an immense number, were in great
demand, as were also his etchings and drawings. His landscapes are
highly esteemed; and many of them have been finely engraved by John
Visscher. His finest pictures are at the Amsterdam Museum and at the

"BERCK, a bathing resort of northern France, in the department of
Pas-de-Calais, 25 m. S. of Boulogne by rail. Pop. (1906) 7638. It
comprises two parts--Berck-Ville, 1½ m. from the shore, and Berck-Plage,
the latter with a fine sandy beach. There are two children's hospitals,
the climate proving peculiarly beneficial in the treatment of scrofulous
affections. About 150 boats are employed in the fisheries, and herrings
form the staple of an active trade. Boat-building and fish-curing are
carried on."
"BERDYANSK, a seaport town of Russia, in the government of Taurida, on
the north coast of the Sea of Azov, in 46° 45' N. lat. and 36° 40' E.
long. The principal industries are in bricks and tiles, tallow and
macaroni. The roads are protected from every wind except the south,
which occasions a heavy surf; but against this a mole was constructed in
1863. The chief articles of export are cereals, flour, wool, hemp, skins
and fish; and the imports include hardwares, fruits, oil and petroleum.
In the immediate neighbourhood are salt-lagoons. Pop. (1867) 12,223;
(1900) 29,168."
"BEREKHIAH NAQDAN, Jewish fabulist, author of a collection of _Fox
Fables_, written in Hebrew. As his title implies (Naqdan=punctuator of

ethical treatise and was the author of various translations. His date is
disputed. Most authorities place him in the 13th century, but J. Jacobs
has identified him with Benedictus le Puncteur, an English Jew of the
12th century."
"His son, RENÊ BÊRENGER (1830-   ), continued the work of his father, and
at the outbreak of the revolution of 1870 was _avocat général_ of Lyons.
He served as a volunteer in the Franco-German War, being wounded at
Nuits on the 28th of December. Returned to the National Assembly by the
department of Drõme, he was for a few days in 1873 minister of public
works under Thiers. He then entered the senate, of which he was
vice-president from 1894 to 1897. He founded in 1871 a society for the
reclamation of discharged prisoners, and presided over various bodies
formed to secure improvement of the public morals. He succeeded Charles
Lucas in 1890 at the Academy of Moral and Political Science."
"(A) 1. BERENICE, daughter of Lagus, wife of an obscure Macedonian
soldier and subsequently of Ptolemy Soter, with whose bride Eurydice she
came to Egypt as a lady-in-waiting. Her son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, was
recognized as heir over the heads of Eurydice's children. So great was
her ability and her influence that Pyrrhus of Epirus gave the name
Berenicis to a new city. Her son Philadelphus decreed divine honours to
her on her death. (See Theocritus, _Idylls_ xv. and xvii.)"
"2. BERENICE, daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus, wife of Antiochus Theos
of Syria, who, according to agreement with Ptolemy (249), had divorced
his wife Laodice and transferred the succession to Berenice's children.
On Ptolemy's death, Antiochus repudiated Berenice and took back Laodice,
who, however, at once poisoned him and murdered Berenice and her son.
The prophecy in Daniel xi. 6 seq. refers to these events."
"5. BERENICE, daughter of Ptolemy Auletes, eldest sister of the great
Cleopatra. The Alexandrines placed her on the throne in succession to
her father (58 B.C.). She married Seleucus Cybiosactes, but soon caused

"BEREZINA, a river of Russia, in the government of Minsk, forming a
tributary of the Dnieper. It rises in the marshes of Borizov and flows
south, inclining to east, for 350 m. (250 m. navigable), for the most
part through low-lying but well-wooded country. As a navigable river,
and forming a portion of the canal system which unites the Black Sea
with the Baltic, it is of importance for commerce, but is subject to
severe floods. It was just above Borizov that Napoleon's army forced the
passage of the Berezina, with enormous losses, on the 26th-28th of
November 1812, during the retreat from Moscow."

mines have been known since 1747. The inhabitants also manufacture
boots, cut stone and carry on cabinet-making."
"The ancient Bergomum was the centre of the tribe of the Orobii; it
became, after their subjection to Rome, a Roman municipality with a
considerable territory, and after its destruction by Attila, became the
capital of a Lombard duchy. From 1264 to 1428 it was under Milan, but
then became Venetian, and remained so until 1797. Remains of the Roman

Bille, 10 m. by rail E. by S. from the city. Pop. (1900) 23,728. It
produces vegetables and fruit for the Hamburg markets, and carries on
tanning, glass manufacture, brewing and brick-making. It received civic
rights in 1275, belonged to Lübeck and Hamburg conjointly from 1420 to
1868, and in the latter year was purchased by Hamburg. The surrounding
district, exceptionally fertile marshland, is known as Die Vierlande,
being divided into four parishes, whence the name is derived."
"Bergen is the birthplace of the poets Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754) and
Johan Welhaven (1807-1873), of Johan Dahl the painter (1788-1857), of

"Bergen (formerly Björgvin) was founded by King Olaf Kyrre in 1070-1075,
and rapidly grew to importance, the Byfjord becoming the scene of
several important engagements in the civil wars of subsequent centuries.
The famous Hansa merchants maintained a failing position here till 1764.
The town suffered frequently from fire, as in 1702 and 1855, and the
broad open spaces (_Almenninge_) which interrupt the streets are
intended as a safeguard against the spread of flames."
"The lordship of Bergen-op-Zoom appears, after the definite union of the
Low Countries with the Empire in 924, as an hereditary fief of the
Empire, and the succession of its lords may be traced from Henry
(1098-1125), who also held Breda. In 1533 it was raised to a margraviate
by the emperor Charles V., and was held by various families until in
1799 it passed, through the Sultzbach branch of the Wittelsbachs, to the
royal house of Bavaria, by whom it was renounced in favour of the
Batavian republic in 1801."

modern façade. The town hall, dating from the latter half of the 19th
century, contains a municipal library and an interesting collection of
pictures. The industries of the town include brewing and malting, and
the manufacture of brushes and oil."
"BERHAMPUR, a town of British India, in the presidency of Madras. Pop.
(1901) 25,729. It is the headquarters of Ganjam district, and is
situated about 9 m. from the sea. It is a station on the East Coast
railway, which connects Calcutta with Madras. Berhampur had a military
cantonment, sometimes distinguished as Baupur, containing a wing of a
native regiment; but the troops have been transferred elsewhere. There
is some weaving of silk cloth, and export trade in sugar. The college,
originally founded by government, is now maintained by the raja of
Kallikota. Silk-weaving and sugar-manufacture are carried on."
"The award, which was signed and published on the 15th of August 1893,
was in favour of Great Britain on all points. The question of damages,
which had been reserved, was ultimately settled by a mixed commission
appointed by the two powers in February 1896, the total amount awarded
to the British sealers being $473,151.26.     (M. H. C.)"
"BERIOT, CHARLES AUGUSTE DE (1802-1870), Belgian violinist and composer.
Although not definitely a pupil of Viotti or Baillot he was much
influenced by both. He was very successful in his concert tours, and
held appointments at the courts of Belgium and France. From 1843 to 1852
he was violin professor at the Brussels conservatoire. Then his eyesight
began to fail, and in 1858 he became blind. His compositions are still
often played, and are good, clean displays of technique."
"BERJA, a town of southern Spain, in the province of Almeria; on the
south-eastern slope of the Sierra de Gádor, 10 m. N.E. of Adra by road.
Pop. (1900) 13,224. Despite the lack of a railway Berja has a
considerable trade. Lead is obtained among the mountains, and the more
sheltered valleys produce grain, wine, oil, fruit and esparto grass.
These, with the paper, linen and cotton goods manufactured locally in
small quantities, are exported from Adra."
"BERKA, a town and watering-place of Germany, in the grand-duchy of
Saxe-Weimar, on the Ilm and the Weimar-Kranichfeld railway, 8 m. S. of
Weimar. Pop. 2300. It has sulphur baths, which are largely frequented in
the summer. Berka was once celebrated for its Cistercian nunnery,
founded in 1251. Two m. down the Ilm is the curious castle of Burgfarth,
partly hewn out of the solid rock."
"Later in the same year the duke of Normandy granted to Robert fitz
Harding Berkeley manor and the appurtenant district called
""Berkelaihernesse,"" to hold in fee by the service of one knight or at a
rent of 100 s. Being at Berkeley, the duke confirmed to Robert a grant
of Bedminster made by Robert, earl of Gloucester, and in the first year
of his reign as king of England he confirmed his own earlier grant of
the Berkeley manor. About this time Robert, who had founded St
Augustine's Priory in Bristol, gave to the Black Canons there the five
churches in Berkeley and Berkeley Herness. In their priory church he was
buried in 1170, Berkeley descending to his son and heir Maurice."
"The victorious Lord Berkeley, whose children died young, was on ill
terms with his next brother, and made havoc of the great Berkeley
estates by grants to the Crown and the royal house, for which he was
rewarded with certain empty titles. Edward IV. gave him a viscount's
patent in 1481, and Richard III. created him earl of Nottingham in 1483.
His complacence extending to the new dynasty, Henry VII. made him earl
marshal in 1485 and marquess of Berkeley in 1487. For this last patent
he, by a settlement following a recovery suffered, gave the king and his
heirs male Berkeley Castle and all that remained to him of his
ancestors' lands, enjoying for his two remaining years a bare life
interest. At his death in 1491 the king took possession, bringing his
queen with him on a visit to Berkeley."
"By these things we may see that peerage law in old time rested upon the
pleasure of the sovereign and upon no ascertained and unvarying custom.
Of the power behind that pleasure this Henry, Lord Berkeley, had one
sharp reminder. He was, like most of his line, a keen sportsman, and,
returning to Berkeley to find that a royal visit had made great
slaughter among his deer, he showed his resentment by disparking
Berkeley Park. Thereat Queen Elizabeth sent him a warning in round Tudor
fashion. Let him beware, she wrote, for the earl of Leicester coveted
the castle by the Severn."
"At the Restoration, George, Lord Berkeley, who had been one of the
commissioners to invite Charles II.'s return from the Hague, petitioned
for a higher place in parliament, claiming a barony by right of tenure
before 1295, but his claim was silenced by his advancement on September
11, 1679, to be viscount of Dursley and earl of Berkeley. James, the 3rd
earl, an active sea captain who was all but lost in company with Sir
Cloudesley Shovel, became knight of the Garter and lord high admiral and
commander-in-chief in the Channel, he and his house being loyal
supporters of the Hanoverian dynasty."
"The last and most curious chapter of the history of the Berkeley honours
was opened by Frederick Augustus, the 5th earl of Berkeley (1745-1810).
This peer married at Lambeth, on the 16th of May 1796, one Mary Cole,
the daughter of a small tradesman at Wotton-under-Edge, with whom he had
already lived for several years, several children having been born to
them. In order to legitimatize the issue born before the marriage, the
earl in 1801 made declaration of an earlier marriage contracted
privately at Berkeley in 1785. On his death in 1811 the validity of this
alleged marriage was tested by the committee of privileges of the House
of Lords, and it was shown without doubt that the evidence for it, a
parish register entry, was a forgery."
"See John Smyth's _Lives of the Berkeleys_, compiled c. 1618, edited by
  Sir John Maclean (1883-1885); J.H. Round's introduction to the
  Somerset Domesday, V.C.H. series; G.E. C(okayne)'s _Complete Peerage_;

  Museum Charters, &c.     (O. Ba.)"
"In 1707 Berkeley published two short mathematical tracts; in 1709, in
his _New Theory of Vision_, he applied his new principle for the first
time, and in the following year stated it fully in the _Principles of
Human Knowledge_. In these works he attacked the existing theories of
externality which to the unphilosophical mind is proved by visual
evidence. He maintained that visual consciousness is merely a system of
arbitrary signs which symbolize for us certain actual or possible
tactual experience--in other words a purely conventional language."
"  With all these defects, however, Berkeley's new conception marks a
  distinct stage of progress in human thought. His true place in the
  history of speculation may be seen from the simple observation that
  the difficulties or obscurities in his scheme are really the points on
  which later philosophy has turned. He once for all lifted the problem
  of metaphysics to a higher level, and, in conjunction with his
  successor, Hume, determined the form into which later metaphysical
  questions have been thrown."
"_Industries._--About seven-ninths of the total area is under
cultivation; a large proportion of this being in permanent pasture, as
much attention is paid to dairy-farming. Butter and cheese are largely
produced, and the making of condensed milk is a branch of the industry.
Many sheep are pastured on the Downs, important sheep-markets being held
at the small town of East or Market Ilsley; and an excellent breed of
pigs is named after the county. The parts about Faringdon are specially
noted for them. Oats are the principal grain crop; although a
considerable acreage is under wheat. Turnips and swedes are largely
cultivated, and apples and cherries are grown. Besides the royal castle
of Windsor, fine county seats are especially numerous."
"The only manufacturing centre of first importance is Reading, which is
principally famous for its biscuit factories. The manufacture of
clothing and carpets is carried on at Abingdon; but a woollen industry
introduced into the county as early as the Tudor period is long extinct.
Engineering works and paper mills are established at various places; and
boat-building is carried on at Reading and other riverside stations.
There are extensive seed warehouses and testing grounds near Reading;
and the Kennet and Windsor ales are in high repute. Whiting is
manufactured from chalk at Kintbury on the Kennet."
"_History._--During the Heptarchy Berkshire formed part of the kingdom of
Wessex, and interesting relics of Saxon occupation have been discovered
in various parts of the county. Of these the most remarkable are the
burial grounds at Long Wittenham and Frilford, and there is evidence
that the Lambourn valley was occupied in early Saxon times. The cinerary
urns found in Berkshire undoubtedly contain the ashes of the Anglians
who came south under Penda in the 7th century. The fortification called
Cherbury Castle, not far from Denchworth, is said to have been first
made up by Canute."
"At the time of the Domesday survey the chief lay-proprietor was Henry de
Ferrers, ancestor of the earls of Derby, but it is remarkable that none
of the great Berkshire estates has remained with the same family long.
Thomas Fuller quaintly observes that ""the lands of Berkshire are very
skittish and apt to cast their owners."" The De la Poles succeeded to
large estates by a marriage with the heiress of Thomas Chaucer, son of
the poet, but the family became extinct in the male line, and the
estates were alienated. The same fate befell the estates of the Achards,
the Fitzwarrens and later the families of Norris and Befils."
"In 1295, Berkshire returned two members to parliament for the county and
two for the borough of Reading. Later the boroughs of Newbury,
Wallingford, Windsor and Abingdon secured representation, and from 1557
until the Reform Act of 1832 the county was represented by a total of
ten members. By this act Abingdon and Wallingford were each deprived of
a member, but the county returned three members instead of two. Since
the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 the county has returned three
members for three divisions, and Windsor and Reading return one member
each, the remaining boroughs having lost representation."

"BÊRLAD, the capital of the department of Tutova, Rumania, on the river
Bêrlad, which waters the high plains of Eastern Moldavia. Pop. (1900)
24,484, about one-fourth of whom are Jews. At Bêrlad the railway from
Jassy diverges, one branch skirting the river Sereth, the other skirting
the Pruth; both reunite at Galatz. Among a maze of narrow and winding
streets Bêrlad possesses a few good modern buildings, including a fine
hospital, administered by the St Spiridion Foundation of Jassy. Bêrlad
has manufactures of soap and candles, and some trade in timber and
farm-produce, while the annual horse-fairs are visited by dealers from
all parts of the country. In the vicinity are traces of a Roman camp."
"See R. Pallmann, _Der historische Goetz von Berlichingen_ (Berlin,
  1894); F.W.G. Graf von Berlichingen-Rossach, _Geschichte des Ritters
  Goetz von Berlichingen und seiner Familie_ (Leipzig, 1861). Goetz's
  _Autobiography_, valuable as a record of his times, was first
  published by Pistorius at Nuremberg (1731), and again at Halle (1886)."
"The boundaries of the city have not been essentially extended since
1860, and though large and important suburbs have crept up and
practically merged with it, its administrative area remains unchanged.
It occupies about 29 sq. m., and has a length from E. to W. of 6 and a
breadth from N. to S. of 5½ m., contains nearly 1000 streets, has 87
squares and open spaces, 73 bridges and a population (1905) of 2,033,900
(including a garrison of about 22,000). If, however, the outer police
district, known as ""Greater Berlin,"" embracing an area of about 10 m.
radius from the centre, be included, the population amounts to about 3¼
millions."
"_Bridges._--Of the numerous bridges, the most remarkable are the
Schloss-brücke, built after designs by Schinkel in 1822-1824, with eight
colossal figures of white marble, representing ideal stages in a
warrior's life, the work of Drake, Albert Wolff and other eminent
sculptors; the Kurfürsten--or Lange-brücke, built 1692-1695, and
restored in 1895, with an equestrian statue of the great elector, and
the Kaiser-Wilhelm-brücke (1886-1889) connecting the Lustgarten with the
Kaiser-Wilhelm-strasse in the inner town. In the modern residential
quarter are the Potsdamer-Viktoria-brücke, which carries the traffic
from two converging streets into the outer Potsdamer-strasse, and the
Herkules-brucke connecting the Lützow-platz with the Tiergarten. The
first three cross the Spree and the last two the Landwehr Canal."
"The Börse, where 4000 persons daily do business, is the chief market in
Germany for stocks and shares, and its dealings are of great influence
upon the gold market of the world. Numerous banks of world-wide
reputation, doing an extensive international business, have their seats
in Berlin, chief among them, in addition to the Reichs-bank, being the
Berliner Kassen-Verein, the Diskonto-Gesellschaft, the Deutsche Bank,
and the Boden-Kredit Bank."
"_Schools._--Berlin possesses fifteen _Gymnasia_ (classical schools, for
the highest branches of the learned professions), of which four are
under the direct supervision of the provincial authorities and have the
prefix _königlich_ (royal), while the remaining eleven are municipal and
under the control of the civic authorities. They are attended by about
7000 scholars, of whom a fourth are Jews. There are also eight
_Real-gymnasia_ (or ""modern"" schools), numerous _Real-schulen_
(commercial schools), public high schools for girls, and commodious and
excellently organized elementary schools."
"The new museum, connected with the old museum by a covered corridor, is,
in its internal arrangements and decorations, one of the finest
structures in the capital. The lowest of its three floors contains the
Egyptian museum; on the first floor plaster casts of ancient, medieval
and modern sculpture are found, while the second contains a cabinet of
engravings. On the walls of the grand marble staircase, which rises to
the full height of the building, Kaulbach's cyclus of stereochromic
pictures is painted, representing the six great epochs of human
progress, from the confusion of tongues at the Tower of Babel and the
dispersion of the nations to the Reformation."
"_Theatres._--In nothing has the importance of Berlin become more
conspicuous than in theatrical affairs. In addition to the
old-established Opernhaus and Schauspielhaus, which are supported by the
state, numerous private playhouses have been erected, notably the
Lessing and the Deutsches theatres, and it is in these that the modern
works by Wildenbruch, Sudermann, and Hauptmann have been produced, and
it may be said that it is in Berlin that the modern school of German
drama has its home. In music Berlin is not able to vie with Leipzig,
Dresden or Munich, yet it is well represented by the Conservatorium,
with which the name of Joachim is connected, while the more modern
school is represented by Xaver Scharwenka."
"_Population._--The stupendous growth of the population of Berlin during
the last century is best illustrated by the following figures. In 1816
it contained 197,717 inhabitants; in 1849, 431,566; in 1871, 826,341;
in 1880, 1,122,330; 1890, 1,578,794, and in 1905, 2,033,900. The
birth-rate is about 30, and the death-rate 20 per 1000 inhabitants a
year. Illegitimate births amount to about 15% of the whole. According to
religion, about 84% are Protestants, 10% Roman Catholics and 5% Jews,
but owing to the great number of Jews who for social and other reasons
ostensibly embrace the Christian faith, these last figures do not
actually represent the number of Jews by descent living in the city."
"_Traffic._--The public streets have a total length of about 350 m., and
a large staff of workmen is regularly employed in maintaining and
cleaning the public roads and parks. The force is well controlled, and
the work of cleaning and removing snow after a heavy fall is thoroughly
and efficiently carried out. The less important thoroughfares are mostly
paved with the so-called Vienna paving, granite bricks of medium size,
while the principal streets, and especially those upon which the traffic
is heavy, have either asphalt or wood paving."
"_Charities._--Berlin is also very richly endowed with charitable
institutions for the relief of pauperism and distress. In addition to
the municipal support of the poor-houses there are large funds derived
from bequests for the relief of the necessitous and deserving poor;
while night shelters and people's kitchens have been organized on an
extensive scale for the temporary relief of the indigent unemployed. For
the former several of the arches of the city railway have been utilized,
and correspond in internal arrangement to like shelters instituted by
the Salvation Army in London and various other cities."
"_Markets._--Open market-places in Berlin are things of the past, and
their place has been taken by airy and commodious market halls. Of
these, 14 in number, the central market, close to the Alexander-platz
station of the city railway with which it is connected by an admirable
service of lifts for the rapid unloading of goods, is the finest. It has
a ground area of about 17,000 sq. yds., and is fitted with more than
2000 stalls. The other markets are conveniently situated at various
accessible places within the city, and the careful police supervision to
which they are subjected, both in the matter of general cleanliness, and
in the careful examination of all articles of food exposed for sale, has
tended to the general health and comfort of the population."
"The central cattle market and slaughter-houses for the inspection and
supply of the fresh meat consumed in the metropolis occupy an extensive
area in the north-east of the city on the Ringbahn, upon which a station
has been erected for the accommodation of meat trains and passengers
attending the market. The inspection is rigorously carried out, and only
carcases which have been stamped as having been certified good are
permitted to be taken away for human consumption."
"_History._--The etymology of the word ""Berlin"" is doubtful. Some derive
it from Celtic roots--_ber_, small, short, and _lyn_, a lake; others
regard it as a Wend word, meaning a free, open place; others, again,
refer it to the word _werl_, a river island. Another authority derives
it from the German word _Brühl_, a marshy district, and the Slavonic
termination _in_; thus Brühl, by the regular transmutation Bührl
(compare Ger. _bren_-nen and Eng. burn), Bürhlin. More recent research,
however, seems to have established the derivation from _Wehr_, dam."
"By Art. XIII. a province was formed south of the Balkans which was to
take the name of ""Eastern Rumelia,"" and was to remain ""under the direct
military and political control of H.I.M. the Sultan, under conditions of
administrative autonomy."" It was to have a Christian governor-general.
Arts. XIV. to XXIII. define the frontiers and organization of the new
province, questions arising out of the Russian occupation, and the
rights of the sultan. Of the latter it is to be noted that the sultan
retained the right of fortifying and occupying the Balkan passes (Art.
XV.) and all his rights and obligations over the railways (Art. XXI.)."
"Art. XXV., which the events of 1908 afterwards brought into special
prominence, runs as follows: ""The provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina
shall be occupied and administered by Austria-Hungary. The government of
Austria-Hungary, not desiring to undertake the administration of the
sanjak of Novi-Bazar, ... the Ottoman administration will continue to
exercise its functions there. Nevertheless, in order to assure the
maintenance of the new political state of affairs, as well as freedom
and security of communications, Austria-Hungary reserves the right of
keeping garrisons and having military and commercial roads in the whole
of this part of the ancient vilayet of Bosnia."""
"Arts. LII. to LVII. deal with the question of the free navigation of the
Danube. All fortifications between the mouths and the Iron Gates were to
be razed, and no vessels of war, save those of light tonnage in the
service of the river police and the customs, were to navigate the river
below the Iron Gates (Art. LII.). The Danube commission, on which
Rumania was to be represented, was maintained in its functions (Art.
LIII.) and provision made for the further prolongation of its powers
(Art. LIV.)."
"By Art. LXI. ""the Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out, without further
delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in
the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their
security against the Circassians and Kurds."" It was to keep the powers
informed periodically of ""the steps taken to this effect."""
"BERLIN, a city and port of entry, Ontario, Canada, and capital of
Waterloo county, 58 m. W. of Toronto, on the Grand Trunk railway. It is
the centre of a prosperous farming and manufacturing district, inhabited
chiefly by German immigrants and their descendants. An electric railway
connects it with the town of Waterloo (pop. 4100) 2 m. to the north,
which has important flour and woollen mills and distilleries. Berlin is
a flourishing manufacturing town, and contains a beet sugar refinery,
automobile, leather, furniture, shirt and collar, felt, glove, button
and rubber factories. Pop. (1881) 4054; (1901) 9747."
"BERLIN, a four-wheeled carriage with a separate hooded seat behind,
detached from the body of the vehicle; so called from having been first
used in Berlin. It was designed about 1670, by a Piedmontese architect
in the service of the elector of Brandenburg. It was used as a
travelling carriage, and Swift refers to it in his advice to authors
""who scribble in a berlin."" As an adjective, the word is used to
indicate a special kind of goods, originally made in Berlin, of which
the best known is Berlin wool. A Berlin warehouse is a shop for the sale
of wools and fancy goods (cf. Italian warehouse). The spelling ""berlin""
is also used by Sir Walter Scott for the ""birlinn,"" a large Gaelic
rowing-boat."
"His literary works include the _Traité d'instrumentation_ (1844);
_Voyage musical en Allemagne et en Italie_ (1845); _Les Soirées
d'orchestre_ (1853); _Les Grotesques de la musique_ (1859); _À travers
chant_ (1862); _Mémoires_ (1870); _Lettres intimes_ (1882). For a full
list of his musical works, Grove's _Dictionary_ should be consulted."
"Adolphe Julien's biography of Berlioz (1888) first gave a careful
  account of the details of his life. See also the books by R. Pohl
  (1884), P. Galibert (1890), E. Hippeau (1890), G. Noufflard (1885), L.
  Mesnard (1888), Louise Pohl (1900), and D. Bernard (trans. by H.M.
  Dunstan, 1882). An illuminating essay on Berlioz is in Filson Young's
  _Mastersingers_ (1902). See also the essay in W.H. Hadow's _Studies in
  Modern Music_ (1st series, 1908). Berlioz's _Traité d'instrumentation_
  has been translated into German and brought up to date by Richard
  Strauss (Peters' edition [1906])."
"BERM (probably a variant of ""brim""), a narrow ledge of ground, generally
the level banks of a river. In parts of Egypt the whole area reached by
the Nile is included in the berm. Thus of the lands near Berber, Mr C.
Dupuis writes (in Sir William Garstin's _Report on the Upper Nile_,
1904), ""In most places there is a well-defined alluvial berm of recent
formation and varying width, up to perhaps a couple of kilometres."" In
military phraseology the berm is the space of ground between the base of
a rampart and the ditch."

"Clairvaux itself had meanwhile (1135-1136) been transformed
outwardly--in spite of the reluctance of Bernard, who preferred the
rough simplicity of the original buildings--into a more suitable seat
for an influence that overshadowed that of Rome itself. How great this
influence was is shown by the outcome of Bernard's contest with Abelard
(q.v.). In intellectual and dialectical power the abbot was no match for
the great schoolman; yet at Sens in 1141 Abelard feared to face him, and
when he appealed to Rome Bernard's word was enough to secure his
condemnation."
"One result of Bernard's fame was the marvellous growth of the Cistercian
order. Between 1130 and 1145 no less than ninety-three monasteries in
connexion with Clairvaux were either founded or affiliated from other
rules, three being established in England and one in Ireland. In 1145 a
Cistercian monk, once a member of the community of Clairvaux--another
Bernard, abbot of Aquae Silviae near Rome, was elected pope as Eugenius
III. This was a triumph for the order; to the world it was a triumph for
Bernard, who complained that all who had suits to press at Rome applied
to him, as though he himself had mounted the chair of St Peter (_Ep_.
239)."
"Bernard was now ageing, broken by his austerities and by ceaseless work,
and saddened by the loss of several of his early friends. But his
intellectual energy remained undimmed. He continued to take an active
interest in ecclesiastical affairs, and his last work, the _De
Consideratione_, shows no sign of failing power. He died on the 20th of
August 1153."
"St Bernard's works were first published in anything like a complete
edition at Paris in 1508, under the title _Seraphica melliflui devotique
doctoris S. Bernardi scripta_, edited by André Bocard; the first really
critical and complete edition is that of Dom J. Mabillon _Sancti
Bernardi opp. &c._ (Paris, 1667, improved and enlarged in 1690, and
again, by Massuet and Texier, in 1719), reprinted by J.P. Migne,
_Patrolog. lat._ (Paris, 1859). There is an English translation of
Mabillon's edition, including, however, only the letters and the sermons
on the Song of Songs, with the biographical and other prefaces, by
Samuel J. Eales (4 vols., London, 1889-1895). See further Leopold
Janauschek, _Bibliographia Bernardina_ (Vienna, 1891), which includes
2761 entries, including 120 works wrongly ascribed to Bernard."
"BERNARD, CHARLES DE, whose full name was PIERRE MARIE CHARLES DE BERNARD
DU GRAIL DE LA VILLETTE (1804-1850), French writer, was born at Besançon
on the 25th of February 1804. After studying for the law, and then
taking to journalism, he was encouraged by Balzac (whose _Peau de
chagrin_ he had reviewed) to settle in Paris and devote himself to
authorship; and the result was a series of volumes of fiction,
remarkable for their picture of provincial society and the Parisian
_bourgeoisie_. The best of these are _Le Noeud gordien_ (1838),
containing among other short stories _Une Aventure de magistrat_, from
which Sardou drew his comedy of the _Pommes du voisin; Gerfaut_ (1838),
considered his masterpiece; _Les Ailes d'Icare_ (1840), _La Peau du
lion_ (1841) and _Le Gentilhomme campagnard_ (1847)."
"His _Oeuvres complètes_ (12 vols.), which appeared after his death on
  the 6th of March 1850, include also his poetry and two comedies
  written in collaboration with ""Léonce"" (C.H.L. Laurençot, 1805-1862).
  A flattering appreciation by Armand de Pontmartin is prefixed to _Un
  Beau-père_ in this collection. In W.M. Thackeray's _Paris Sketch-book_
  (""On some fashionable French novels"") there is an admirable criticism

"The first edition of his works, for the most part elaborate sermons,
  was printed at Lyons in 1501; later ones in 1636, 1650 and 1745. His
  Life will be found in the Bollandists and in _Lives of the Saints_ on
  the 20th of May: a good modern biography has been written by Paul
  Thureau-Dangin (1896), and translated into English by Gertrude von

"BERNAUER, AGNES (d. 1435), daughter of an Augsburg baker, was secretly
married about 1432 to Albert (1401-1460), son of Ernest, duke of
Bavaria-Munich. Ignorant of the fact that this union was a lawful one,
Ernest urged his son to marry, and reproached him with his connexion
with Agnes. Albert then declared she was his lawful wife; and
subsequently, during his absence, she was seized by order of Duke Ernest
and condemned to death for witchcraft. On the 12th of October 1435 she
was drowned in the Danube near Straubing, in which town her remains were
afterwards buried by Albert. This story lived long in the memory of the
people, and its chief interest lies in its literary associations. It has
afforded material for several dramas, and Adolf Böttger, Friedrich
Hebbel and Otto Ludwig have each written one entitled _Agnes Bernauer_."
"Bernburg is of great antiquity. The Bergstadt was fortified by Otto III.
in the 10th century, and the new town was founded in the 13th. For a
long period the different parts were under separate municipalities, the
new town uniting with the old in 1560, and the Bergstadt with both in
1824. Prince Frederick removed the ducal residence to Ballenstedt in
1765."
"A biographical account of Berners is to be found in Mr Sidney Lee's
  introduction to _Huon of Bourdeaux_ (Early English Text Society
  1882-1883). Among the many editions of his translation of Froissart
  may be mentioned that in the ""Tudor Translations"" (1901), with an
  introductory critical note by Professor W.P. Ker."
"BERNKASTEL, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, on the
Mosel, in a deep and romantic valley, connected by a branch to Wengerohr
with the main Trier-Coblenz railway. Pop. 2300. It has some unimportant
manufactures; the chief industry is in wine, of which Berncastler Doctor
enjoys great repute. Above the town lie the ruins of the castle
Landshut. Bernkastel originally belonged to the chapter of Trier, and
received its name from one of the provosts of the cathedral, Adalbero of
Luxemburg (hence _Adalberonis castellum_)."
"In 1687 the mathematical chair of the university of Basel was conferred
upon Jacques. He was once made rector of his university, and had other
distinctions bestowed on him. He and his brother Jean were the first two
foreign associates of the Academy of Sciences of Paris; and, at the
request of Leibnitz, they were both received as members of the academy
of Berlin. In 1684 he had been offered a professorship at Heidelberg;
but his marriage with a lady of his native city led him to decline the
invitation. Intense application brought on infirmities and a slow fever,
of which he died on the 16th of August 1705. Like another Archimedes, he
requested that the logarithmic spiral should be engraven on his
tombstone, with these words, _Eadem mutata resurgo_."
"Jacques Bernoulli wrote elegant verses in Latin, German and French;
  but although these were held in high estimation in his own time, it is
  on his mathematical works that his fame now rests. These are:--_Jacobi
  Bernoulli Basiliensis Opera_ (Genevae, 1744), 2 tom. 4to; _Ars
  Conjectandi, opus posthumum: accedunt tractatus de Seriebus Infinitis,
  et epistola (Gallice scripta) de Ludo Pilae Reticularis_ (Basiliae,
  1713), 1 tom. 4to."
"His writings were collected under his own eye by Gabriel Cramer,
  professor of mathematics at Geneva, and published under the title of
  _Johannis Bernoulli Operi Omnia_ (Lausan. et Genev.), 4 tom. 4to; his
  interesting correspondence with Leibnitz appeared under the title of
  _Gul. Leibnitii et Johannis Bernoulli Commercium Philosophicum et
  Mathematicum_ (Lausan. et Genev. 1745), 2 tom. 4to."
"Several of his investigations are contained in the earlier volumes of
  the _Comment. Acad. Petropol._; and his separately published works
  are:--_Dissertatio Inaugur. Phys. Med. de Respiratione_ (Basil. 1721),
  4to; _Positiones Anatomico-Botanicae_ (Basil. 1721), 4to;

"V. JEAN BERNOULLI (1710-1790), the youngest of the three sons of Jean
Bernoulli, was born at Basel on the 18th of May 1710. He studied law and
mathematics, and, after travelling in France, was for five years
professor of eloquence in the university of his native city. On the
death of his father he succeeded him as professor of mathematics. He was
thrice a successful competitor for the prizes of the Academy of Sciences
of Paris. His prize subjects were, the capstan, the propagation of
light, and the magnet. He enjoyed the friendship of P.L.M. de
Maupertuis, who died under his roof while on his way to Berlin. He
himself died in 1790. His two sons, Jean and Jacques, are the last noted
mathematicians of the family."
"VI. NICOLAS BERNOULLI (1687-1759), cousin of the three preceding, and
son of Nicolas Bernoulli, one of the senators of Basel, was born in that
city on the 10th of October 1687. He visited England, where he was
kindly received by Sir Isaac Newton and Edmund Halley (_Com. Phil._ ep.
199), held for a time the mathematical chair at Padua, and was
successively professor of logic and of law at Basel, where he died on
the 29th of November 1759. He was editor of the _Ars Conjectandi_ of his
uncle Jacques. His own works are contained in the _Acta Eruditorum_, the
_Giornale de' letterati d' Italia_, and the _Commercium Philosophicum_."
"VII. JEAN BERNOULLI (1744-1807), grandson of the first Jean Bernoulli,
and son of the second of that name, was born at Basel on the 4th of
November 1744. He studied at Basel and at Neuchâtel, and when thirteen
years of age took the degree of doctor in philosophy. At nineteen he was
appointed astronomer royal of Berlin. Some years after, he visited
Germany, France and England, and subsequently Italy, Russia and Poland.
On his return to Berlin he was appointed director of the mathematical
department of the academy. Here he died on the 13th of July 1807. His
writings consist of travels and astronomical, geographical and
mathematical works. In 1774 he published a French translation of
Leonhard Euler's _Elements of Algebra_. He contributed several papers to
the Academy of Berlin."
"Several of his papers are contained in the first six volumes of _Nova
  Acta Acad. Scien. Imper. Petropol._, in the _Acta Helvetica_, in the
  _Memoirs of the Academies of Berlin and Turin_, and in his brother

"BERNSTEIN, AARON (1812-1884), Jewish scientist, author and reformer. In
the middle of the 19th century Bernstein took an active share in the
movement for synagogue reform in Germany. He was the author of two
delightful Ghetto stories, _Vögele der Maggid_ and _Mendel Gibbor_,
being one of the originators of this _genre_ of modern fiction. He was
also a publicist, and his _History of Revolution and Reaction in
Germany_ (3 vols., 1883-1884) was a collection of important political
essays."
"Count Bernstorff was twice married, his wives being the two sisters of
the writers Counts Christian and Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg. He left
seven sons and three daughters. Of his sons the best known is Christian
Günther, count von Bernstorff. Another, Count Joachim, was attached to
his brother's fortunes so long as he remained in the Danish service, was
associated with him in representing Denmark at the congress of Vienna,
and in 1815 was appointed ambassador at that court."

"From 1824 onward Bernstorff had been a constant sufferer from hereditary
gout, intensified and complicated by the results of overwork. In the
spring of 1832 the state of his health compelled him to resign the
ministry of foreign affairs to Ancillon, who had already acted as his
deputy for a year. He died on the 18th of March 1835."

"BERSERKER (from the ""sark"" or shirt of the ""bear,"" or other animal-skins
worn by them), in Scandinavian mythology, the name of the twelve sons of
the hero Berserk, grandson of the eight-handed Starkadder and Alfhilde.
Berserk was famed for the reckless fury with which he fought, always
going into battle without armour. By the daughter of King Swafurlam,
whom he had killed, he had the twelve sons who were his equals in
bravery. In Old Norse the term _berserker_ thus became synonymous with
reckless courage, and was later applied to the bodyguards of several of
the Scandinavian heroes."
"BERTHOUD, FERDINAND (1727-1807), Swiss chronometer-maker, was born at
Plancemont, Neuchâtel, in 1727, and settling in Paris in 1745 gained a
great reputation for the excellence and accuracy of his chronometers. He
was a member of the Institute and a fellow of the Royal Society of
London, and among other works wrote _Essais sur l'horlogerie_ (1763). He
died in 1807 at Montmorency, Seine et Oise. He was succeeded in business
by his nephew, Louis Berthoud (1759-1813)."
"BERTILLON, LOUIS ADOLPHE (1821-1883), French statistician, was born in
Paris on the 1st of April 1821. Entering the medical profession, he
practised as a doctor for a number of years. After the revolution of
1870, he was appointed inspector-general of benevolent institutions. He
was one of the founders of the school of anthropology of Paris, and was
appointed a professor there in 1876. His _Démographie figurée de la
France_ (1874) is an able statistical study of the population of France.
He died at Neuilly on the 28th of February 1883."
"His son ALPHONSE BERTILLON, the anthropometrist, was born in Paris in
1853. He published in 1883 a work _Ethnographie moderne des races
sauvages_, but his chief claim to distinction lies in the system
invented by him for the identification of criminals, which is described
by him in his _Photographie judiciaire_, Paris, 1890 (see
ANTHROPOMETRY). He was officially appointed in 1894 to report on the
handwriting of the _bordereau_ in the Dreyfus case, and was a witness
for the prosecution before the cour de cassation on the 18th of January
1899."
"BERTINORO, OBADIAH, Jewish commentator of the Mishnah, died in Jerusalem
about 1500. Bertinoro much improved the status of the Jews in the Holy
Land; before his migration thither the Jews of Palestine were in a
miserable condition of poverty and persecution. His commentary on the
Mishnah is the most useful of all helps to the understanding of that
work. It is printed in most Hebrew editions of the Mishnah. Surenhusius,
in his Latin edition of the last-named code (Amsterdam 1698-1703),
translated Bertinoro's commentary."
"BERTINORO, a town and episcopal see of Emilia, Italy, in the province of

Forlimpopoli, and 800 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) town, 3753;
commune, 7786. The town commands a fine view to the north over the plain
of Emilia and the lower course of the Po, itself lying on the foothills
of the Apennines. It appears to have been first fortified by Frederick
Barbarossa, and its castle stood frequent sieges in the middle ages.
Polenta, 2½ m. to the south of it, was the birthplace of Francesca da
Rimini. The castle is almost entirely ruined, but the church of S.
Donato, of the Lombard period, with Byzantine capitals, is interesting;
Giosuè Carducci has written a fine ode on the subject (_La Chiesa di
Polenta_, Bologna, 1897)."

"The reach of the river from the old bridge to the mouth forms the
harbour. The entrance to the harbour is protected by a stone pier, which
stretches half a mile south-east from the north bank of the river mouth.
The depth of water at the bar is 17 ft. at ordinary tides, 22 ft. at
spring tides, but the channel is narrow, a large rocky portion of the
harbour on the north side being dry at low water. There is a wet dock of
3½ acres. Principal exports are grain, coal and fish; imports are bones
and bone-ash, manure stuffs, linseed, salt, timber and iron. The herring
and other sea fisheries are of some value, and the salmon fishery, in
the hands of a company, has long been famous. A fair is held annually
at the end of May. There are iron-works and boat-building yards."
"The custom of specially mentioning Berwick-upon-Tweed after Wales,
though abandoned in acts of parliament, is retained in certain
proclamations. The title of ""county in itself"" also helps to recall its
ancient history. The liberties of the borough, commonly called Berwick
Bounds, include the towns of Spittal, at the mouth, and Tweedmouth
immediately above it, on the south bank of the river. The first is a
watering-place (pop. 2074), with pleasant sands and a chalybeate spa;
the second (pop. 3086) has iron foundries, engineering works and
fish-curing establishments. Berwick-upon-Tweed is governed by a mayor, 6
aldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 6396 acres."
"BERYL, a mineral containing beryllium and aluminium in the form of a
silicate; its formula is Be3Al2Si6O18. The species includes the emerald
(q.v.), the aquamarine (q.v.) and other transparent varieties known as
""precious beryl,"" with certain coarse varieties unfit for use as
gem-stones. The name comes from the Gr. [Greek: baeryllos], a word of
uncertain etymology applied to the beryl and probably several other
gems. It is notable that the relation of the emerald to the beryl,
though proved only by chemical analysis, was conjectured at least as far
back as the time of Pliny."
"Beryl crystallizes in the hexagonal system, usually taking the form of
long six-sided prisms, striated vertically and terminated with the basal
plane, sometimes associated with various pyramidal faces (see fig.). It
cleaves rather imperfectly parallel to the base. The colour of beryl may
be blue, green, yellow, brown or rarely pink; while in some cases the
mineral is colourless. The specific gravity is about 2.7, and the
hardness 7.5 to 8, so that for a gem-stone beryl is comparatively soft.
Whilst the gem-varieties are transparent, the coarse beryl may be
opaque. The transparent crystals are pleochroic--a character well marked
in emerald."
"Beryl was much prized as a gem-stone by the ancients, and Greek
intaglios of very fine workmanship are extant. The Roman jewellers,
taking advantage of the columnar form of the natural crystal, worked it
into long cylinders for ear-pendants. It was a favourite stone with the
artists of the Renaissance, but in modern times has lost popularity,
except in the form of emerald, which remains one of the most valued
gem-stones. It is notable that English lapidaries of the 18th century
often included the sard under the term beryl--a practice which has led
to some confusion in the nomenclature of engraved gems."
"Many localities in the United States yield beryl, sometimes sufficiently
fine to be cut as a gem. It is found, for example, at Hiddenite and
elsewhere in Alexander county, N.C.; at Haddam and Monroe, Conn.; at
Stoneham and at Albany, in Oxford county, Maine; at Royalston, Mass.;
and at Mt. Antero, Colorado, where it occurs with phenacite. Beryl of
beautiful pink colour occurs in San Diego county, California. Coarse
beryl, much rifted, is found in crystals of very large size at Grafton
and Acworth, N.H.; a crystal from Grafton weighing more than 2½ tons. A
colourless beryl from Goshen, Mass., has been called Goshenite; whilst
crystals of coarse yellow beryl from Rubislaw quarry in Aberdeenshire,
Scotland, have been termed Davidsonite."
"The carbide BeC2 is formed when beryllia and sugar charcoal are heated
  together in the electric furnace. Like aluminium carbide it is slowly
  decomposed by water with the production of methane. Several basic
  carbonates are known, being formed by the addition of beryllium salts
  to solutions of the alkaline carbonates; the normal carbonate is
  prepared by passing a current of carbon dioxide through water
  containing the basic carbonate in suspension, the solution being
  filtered and concentrated over sulphuric acid in an atmosphere of
  carbon dioxide. The crystals so obtained are very unstable and
  decompose rapidly with evolution of carbon dioxide."
"BERYLLONITE, a mineral phosphate of beryllium and sodium, NaBePO4, found
as highly complex orthorhombic crystals and as broken fragments in the
disintegrated material of a granitic vein at Stoneham, Maine, where it
is associated with felspar, smoky quartz, beryl and columbite. It was
discovered by Prof. E.S. Dana in 1888, and named beryllonite because it
contains beryllium in large amount. The crystals vary from colourless to
white or pale yellowish, and are transparent with a vitreous lustre;
there is a perfect cleavage in one direction. Hardness 5½-6; specific
gravity 2.845. A few crystals have been cut and faceted, but, as the
refractive index is no higher than that of quartz, they do not make very
brilliant gem-stones."

"The remarkable connexion between Bessel's functions and spherical
harmonics was established in 1868 by F.G. Mehler, who proved that a
simple relation existed between the function of zero order and the zonal
harmonic of order n. Heinrich Eduard Heine has shown that the functions
of higher orders may be considered as limiting values of the associated
functions; this relation was discussed independently, in 1878, by Lord
Rayleigh."
"His younger brother, BERTRAND, BARON BESSIÈRES (1773-1855), was a
distinguished divisional leader under Napoleon. After serving with a
good record in Italy, in Egypt and at Hohenlinden, he had a command in
the _Grande Armée_, and in 1808 was sent to Spain. He commanded a
division in Catalonia and played a notable part at the action of Molins
de Rey near Barcelona. Disagreements with his superior, General Duhesme,
led to his resignation, but he subsequently served with Napoleon in all
the later campaigns of the empire. Placed on the retired list by the
Bourbons, his last public act was his defence of the unfortunate Ney.
The rest of his long life was spent in retirement."
"BESSUS, satrap of Bactria and Sogdiana under Darius III. In the battle
of Gaugamela (1st of October 331) he commanded the troops of his
satrapy. When Alexander pursued the Persian king on his flight to the
East (summer 330), Bessus with some of the other conspirators deposed
Darius and shortly afterwards killed him. He then tried to organize a
national resistance against the Macedonian conqueror in the eastern
provinces, proclaimed himself king and adopted the name Artaxerxes. But
he was taken prisoner by treachery in the summer of 329. Alexander sent
him to Ecbatana, where he was condemned to death. Before his execution
his nose and ears were cut off, according to the Persian custom; we
learn from the Behistun inscription that Darius I. punished the usurpers
in the same way."
"His command over all the resources of his own instrument was masterly;
his series of Saturday recitals at St George's Hall, carried on for many
years, included the whole field of organ music, and of music that could
be arranged for the organ, ancient and modern; and his performances of
Bach's organ works were particularly fine. His own compositions for the
organ, chiefly comprised in the publication entitled _Organ Pieces for
Church Use_, have a strong and marked individuality. Best, unlike many
soloists, was an all-round musician, and fully acquainted with every
branch of the art. His bust, by Conrad Dressler, has been placed on the
platform in front of the Liverpool organ, as a memorial of his long
series of performances there."
"2. LUCIUS CALPURNIUS BESTIA, one of the Catilinarian conspirators,
possibly a grandson of the above. He was tribune elect in 63, and it had
been arranged that, after entering upon his office, he should publicly
accuse Cicero of responsibility for the impending war. This was to be
the signal for the outbreak of revolution. The conspiracy, however, was
put down and Bestia had to content himself with delivering a violent
attack upon the consul on the expiration of his office. This Bestia is
probably not the Lucius Calpurnius Bestia, aedile, and a candidate for
the praetorship in 57. He was accused of bribery during his candidature,
and, in spite of Cicero's defence, was condemned. In 43 he attached
himself to the party of Antony, apparently in the hope of obtaining the
consulship."

carboxylic acids from the potassium salts of the acids, by treatment
with methyl iodide, followed by moist silver oxide. The reaction may be

_trigonelline_, which was discovered in 1885 by E. Jahns in the seeds of
_Trigonella faenum-graecum_ (_Ber._, 1885, 18, p. 2518). It has also
been obtained from nicotine by A. Pictet by oxidizing the methyl
hydroxide of nicotine with potassium permanganate (_Ber._, 1897, 30, p.
2117)."
"Substances closely related to betaïne are choline, neurine and
  muscarine. Choline (bilineurine, sincaline), (Gr. [Greek: cholae],
  bile), C5H15NO2 or HO·CH2·CH2·N(CH3)3·OH, first isolated by A.

  It is also found in combination with sinapic acid in sinapin, the
  glucoside obtained from white mustard, and can be obtained from this
  glucoside by hydrolysis with baryta water,"
"It can be synthetically prepared by the action of trimethylamine on an
  aqueous solution of ethylene oxide (A. Wurtz, _Ann. Suppl._, 1868, 6,

  and absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. It is not poisonous. By
  continued boiling of its aqueous solution, it is resolved into glycol
  and trimethylamine."
"It is a crystalline solid, very soluble in water, and is strongly
  basic and very poisonous. Muscarine, C5H15NO3, is an exceedingly
  poisonous substance found in many fungi. It may be obtained

  together with three other alkaloids: arecoline, C8H13NO2, guvacine,
  C6H9NO2, and arecaine, C7H11NO2. Arecaidine forms white crystals
  easily soluble in water, and difficultly soluble in alcohol.
  Chemically it is methyl-tetrahydro-nicotinic acid. Dehydration results
  in the formation of a ""betaïne,"" which is a tetrahydro-trigonelline
  (see BETAÏNE). Arecoline is an oil, and the physiological action of
  the betel nut is alone due to this substance. Chemically it is the
  methyl ester of arecaidine. Guvacine, named from ""guvaca,"" an Indian
  designation of the betel palm, forms white crystals. It is a secondary
  base, but its constitution is uncertain. Arecaine is
  n-methyl-guvacine."
"BETHESDA (i.e. ""House of Mercy,"" John v. 2), better perhaps BETHZATHA or
BETHSAIDA, a pool or public bath in Jerusalem, where miraculous cures
were believed to be performed. The following identifications have been
suggested: _Birket Isra'il_, near St Stephen's gate; a large cistern,
near St Anne's church; the ""Twin Pools,"" north of the Haram (the ancient
Temple area); the _Hammam esh-Shifa'_ or pool of healing, west of the
Haram; the Virgin's fountain, south of the Haram; and the ""Pool of
Siloam."" Which, if any, of these identifications is correct, it is
impossible to say."
"BETHESDA, an urban district of Carnarvonshire, N. Wales, 5 m. from
Bangor, by a branch of the London & North-Western railway. Pop. (1901)
5281. It lies near the lower end of the fine Nant Ffrancon (valley of
the Ogwen stream). The scriptural name is due, as often in Wales, to the
village or hamlet taking its title from the Nonconformist church. Here
are extensive slate quarries belonging to Lord Penrhyn. A narrow-gauge
railway connects these with Port Penrhyn, at the mouth of the stream
Cegid (hemlock, ""_cicuta_""), which admits the entry of vessels of 300
tons to the quay at low water."
"BETH-HORON (""the place of the hollow way""), the name of two neighbouring
villages, upper and lower Beth-horon, on the ascent from the coast plain
of Palestine to the high tableland of Benjamin, which was until the 16th
century the high road from Jerusalem to the sea. The two towns thus
played a conspicuous part in Israelitish military history (see Josh. x.
10; 1 Sam. xiii. 18; 1 Kings ix. 17; 1 Macc. iii. 13-24, vii. 39 ff.,
ix. 50). Josephus (_Bell. Jud._ ii. 19) tells of the rout of a Roman
army under Cestius Gallus in A.D. 66. The Talmud states that many rabbis
were born in the place. It is now represented by Beit 'Ur-el-foka and
Beit 'Ur-et-tahta."
"Gabriel Bethlen was certainly one of the most striking and original
personages of his century. A zealous Calvinist, whose boast it was that
he had read the Bible twenty-five times, he was nevertheless no
persecutor, and even helped the Jesuit Kaldy to translate and print his
version of the Scriptures. He was in communication all his life with the
leading contemporary statesmen, so that his correspondence is one of the
most interesting and important of historical documents. He also composed
hymns."
"The best editions of his correspondence are those by Sándor Szilágyi,
  both published at Buda (1866 and 1879). The best life of him is that
  by the Bohemian historian Anton Gindely, _Acta et documenta historiam
  Gabrielis Bethleni illustrantia_ (Budapest, 1890). This work has been
  largely utilized by Ignáe-Acsády in his excellent _Gabriel Bethlen and
  his Court_ (Hung., Budapest, 1890).     (R. N. B.)"
"The town, which dates from the 11th century, was governed by its own
lords till 1248, after which date it passed through the ownership of the
counts of Flanders, the dukes of Burgundy, and the sovereigns of Austria
and Spain. Ceded to France by the peace of Nijmwegen (1678), it was
taken by the allied forces in 1710, and restored to France by the treaty
of Utrecht."
"Among the ancient Jews betrothal was formal and as binding as marriage.
After the ceremony, which consisted of the handing of a ring or some
object of value to the bride and formal words of contract, and the
mutual pledging of the couple in consecrated wine, a period of twelve
months elapsed before the marriage was completed by the formal
home-taking; unless the bride was a widow or the groom a widower, when
this interval was reduced to thirty days. Latterly the ceremony of
betrothal has become a part of the marriage ceremony, and the engagement
has become the informal affair it is in England."
"For betrothal customs in China, the East and elsewhere, consult L.J.
  Miln, _Wooings and Weddings in Many Climes_ (London, 1900), and H.N.
  Hutchinson, _Marriage Customs in Many Lands_ (London, 1897). On early

"BETTIA, a town of British India, in the Champaran district of Bengal;
situated on a former branch of the Harha river, with a station on the
Tirhoot section of the Bengal & North-Western railway. Bettia is the
residence of one of the leading noblemen of northern Behar, who enjoys a
rent-roll of £66,000. In 1901, owing to a disputed succession, the
estate was under the management of the court of wards. It comprises land
in no fewer than ten districts, much of which is let on permanent leases
to indigo-planters. Besides the palace of the maharaja, the town
contains a middle English school and a female dispensary, entirely
supported out of the estate. There is a Roman Catholic mission, with
about 1000 converts, which was founded by an Italian priest in 1746."
"BETWA, a river of India, which rises in the native state of Bhopal in
Malwa, and after a course of 360 m., for the most part in a
north-easterly direction, falls into the Jumna at Hamirpur. A weir is
thrown across the Betwa about 15 m. from Jhansi town, whence a canal 168
m. long takes off, irrigating 106,000 acres of the Jalaun district;
similar works have been carried out elsewhere on the river."
"His son, AUGUSTE ARTHUR BEUGNOT (1797-1865), was an historian and
scholar, who published an _Essai sur les institutions de Saint Louis_
(1821), _Histoire de la destruction du paganisme en occident_ (2 vols.,
1885), and edited the _Olim_ of the parlement of Paris, the _Assizes of
Jerusalem_, and the _Coutumes de Beauvoisis_ of Philippe de Beaumanoir.
He was a member of the chamber of peers under Louis Philippe, and
opposed Villemain's plan for freedom of education. After 1848 he
maintained the same rôle, acting as reporter of the _loi Falloux_. He
retired from public life after the _coup d'état_ of Napoleon III., and
died on the 15th of March 1865."
"As early as December 1870 he had opened a correspondence with Bismarck
with a view to establishing a good understanding with Germany. Bismarck
accepted his advances with alacrity, and the new _entente_, which Beust
announced to the Austro-Hungarian delegations in July 1871, was sealed
in August by a friendly meeting of the two old rivals and enemies at
Gastein."
"Beust was the author of reminiscences: _Aus drei
  Viertel-Jahrhunderten_ (2 vols., Stuttgart, 1887; English trans.
  edited by Baron H. de Worms); and he also wrote a shorter work,
  _Erinnerungen zu Erinnerungen_ (Leipzig, 1881), in answer to attacks

district of Upper Silesia, and its population is mainly engaged in such
operations and in iron and zinc smelting. Beuthen is an old town, and
was formerly the capital of the Bohemian duchy of Beuthen, which in 1620
was ultimately granted, as a free lordship of the Empire, to Lazarus,
Baron Henckel von Donnersmarck, by the emperor Ferdinand II., and parts
of which, now mediatized, are held by two branches of the counts Henckel
von Donnersmarck."

parliamentary division of Worcestershire, England; 137 m. N.W. by W.
from London and 17¼ N. by W. from Worcester by rail. Pop. (1901) 2866.
The Worcester-Shrewsbury line of the Great Western is here joined by
lines east from Birmingham and west from Tenbury. Bewdley is pleasantly
situated on the sloping right bank of the Severn, on the eastern border
of the forest of Wyre. A bridge by Telford (1797) crosses the river. A
free grammar school, founded in 1591, was re-founded by James I. in
1606, and possesses a large library bequeathed in 1812. The town
manufactures combs and horn goods, brass and iron wares, leather, malt,
bricks and ropes. The town is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12
councillors. Area, 2105 acres."
"BEXHILL, a municipal borough and watering-place in the Rye parliamentary
division of Sussex, England, 62 m. S.E. by S. from London, on the
London, Brighton & South Coast, and the South-Eastern & Chatham
railways. Pop. (1891) 5206; (1901) 12,213. The ancient village, with the
Norman and Early English church of St Peter, lies inland on the slope of
the low hills fringing the coast, but the watering-place on the shore
has developed very rapidly since about 1884, owing to the exertions of
Earl De la Warr, who owns most of the property. It has a marine parade,
pier, golf links, and the usual appointments of a seaside resort, while
the climate is bracing and the neighbouring country pleasant. Bexhill
was incorporated in 1902, the corporation consisting of a mayor, 6
aldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 8013 acres."
"BEXLEY, an urban district in the Dartford parliamentary division of
Kent, England, 12 m. S.E. by E. of London by the South-Eastern & Chatham
railway. Pop. (1901) 12,918. Bexley, which is mentioned in Domesday
Book, has had a church since the 9th century. The present church of St
Mary is Early English and later. With the rental of the manor of Bexley,
William Camden, the antiquary, founded the ancient history professorship
at Oxford. Hall Place, which contains a fine Jacobean staircase and
oak-panelled hall, is said to occupy the site of the dwelling-place of
the Black Prince. The course of Watling Street may be traced over Bexley
Heath, where, too, there exist deep pits, widening into vaults below,
and probably of British origin."
"BEY (a modern Turk, word, the older form being _beg_, cf. Pers. _baig_),
the administrator of a district, now generally an honorific title
throughout the Turkish empire; the granting of this in Egypt is made by
the sultan of Turkey through the khedive. In Tunis ""bey"" has become the
hereditary title of the reigning sovereigns (see TUNISIA)."
"BEYBAZAR, the chief town of a _kaza_ of the Angora vilayet in Asiatic
Turkey, situated on an affluent of the Sakaria (anc. _Sangarius_), about
52 m. W. of Angora. It corresponds to the anc. _Lagania_, renamed
_Anastasiopolis_ under the emperor Anastasius (491-518), a bishopric by
the 5th century. Its well-built wooden houses cover the slopes of three
hills at the mouth of a gorge filled with fruit gardens and vineyards.
The chief products are rice, cotton and fruits. From Beybazar come the
fine pears sold in Constantinople as ""Angora pears""; its musk-melons are
equally esteemed; its grapes are used only for a sweetmeat called
_jevizli-sujuk_ (""nutty fruit sausage""). There are few remains of
antiquity apart from numerous rock-cut chambers lining the banks of the
stream. Pop. about 4000 to 5000."

"BEZANT or BYZANT (from Byzantium, the modern Constantinople), originally
a Byzantine gold coin which had a wide circulation throughout Europe up
to about 1250. Its average value was about nine shillings. Bezants were
also issued in Flanders and Spain. Silver bezants, in value from one to
two shillings, were in circulation in England in the 13th and 14th
centuries. In Wycliffe's translation of the Bible he uses the word for a
""talent"" (e.g. in Luke xv. 8). In heraldry, bezants are represented by
gold circles on the shield, and were introduced by the crusaders."

"BEZEL (from an O. Fr. word, cf. Mod. Fr. _biseau_, _basile_, possibly
connected with Lat. _bis_, twice), a sloping edge, as of a cutting tool,
also known as basil. In jewelry, the term is used for the oblique sides
or faces of a gem; the rim which secures the crystal of a watch in
position or a jewel in its setting, and particularly the enlarged part
of a ring on which the device is engraved (see RING)."
"The Romans established a colony at Béziers, and it was the headquarters
of the seventh legion, under the title of _Baeterrae Septimanorum_. The
present name occurs in the form _Besara_ as early as Festus Avienus
(later 4th century). The town was completely destroyed in 1209 by the
forces of Simon de Montfort in the crusade against the Albigenses, on
which occasion 20,000 persons were massacred. The walls were rebuilt in
1289; but the town again suffered severely in the civil and religious
wars of the 16th century, and all its fortifications were destroyed in
1632."
"BÉZIQUE (probably from Span. _besico_, little kiss, in allusion to the
meeting of the queen and knave, an important feature in the game), a
game at cards played with two similar packs from which the twos, threes,
fours, fives and sixes have been rejected, shuffled together and used as
one. It is modelled on a group of card games which possess many features
in common; the oldest of these is _mariage_, then follow _brusquembille,
l'homme de brou, briscan_ or _brisque_, and _cinq-cents_. Bézique (also
called _besi_ and _besigue_) is, in fact, _brisque_ played with a double
pack, and with certain modifications rendered necessary by the
introduction of additional cards. The cards rank as follows:--Ace, ten,
king, queen, knave, nine, eight, seven."
"  When four play four packs are used. The players may then score
  independently or may play as partners. A second double bézique or
  triple bézique may be scored as before; to form them the béziques may
  be declared from the hand of either partner. A player may declare when
  he or his partner takes a trick. In playing the last eight tricks, the
  winner of the last trick and the adversary to his left play their
  cards against each other, and then the other two similarly play
  theirs. Four people may also play in pairs by consultation, only two
  packs being then required."
"  The ordinary rule holds that a second declaration cannot be made of a
  card already declared in the same class. Thus: a queen once married,
  cannot be married again; a fifth king added to four already declared
  does not entitle to another score for kings. The fundamental point to
  be borne in mind is, that no declaration can be effected by means of
  cards held in the hand. Thus: A having three open queens and a queen
  in hand cannot add it to his open cards. He must win another trick
  containing a queen, when he can declare queens. Declarations continue
  during the play of the last eight tricks just the same as during the
  play of the other cards."
"BHAGALPUR, a city of British India, in the Behar province of Bengal,
which gives its name to a district and to a division; situated on the
right bank of the Ganges, 265 m. from Calcutta. It is a station on the
East Indian railway. Pop. (1901) 75,760, showing an increase of 9% in
the decade. The chief educational institution is the Tejnarayan Jubilee
college (1887), supported almost entirely by fees. Adjacent to the town
are the two Augustus Cleveland monuments, one erected by government, and
the other by the Hindus, to the memory of the civilian, who, as
collector of Bhagalpur at the end of the 18th century, ""by conciliation,
confidence and benevolence, attempted and accomplished the entire
subjection of the lawless and savage inhabitants of the Jungleterry of
Rajmahal."""
"There are indigo factories, and other industries include the weaving of
tussur silk and the making of coarse glass. A large trade is carried on
by rail and river with Lower Bengal. The tract south of the Ganges is
traversed by the loop-line of the East Indian railway, and there is also
a railway across the northern tract."
"BHANDARA, a town and district of British India, in the Nagpur division
of the Central Provinces. The town (pop. in 1901, 14,023) is situated on
the left bank of the river Wainganga, 7 m. from a station on the
Bengal-Nagpur railway. It has considerable manufactures of cotton cloth
and brass-ware, and a first-grade middle school, with a library."
"Bhandara district contains 25 semi-independent chiefships. These little
states are exempted from the revenue system, and only pay a light
tribute. Their territory, however, is included within the returns of
area and population above given. The climate of Bhandara is
unhealthy,--the prevailing diseases being fever, small-pox and cholera.
Nothing is known of the early history of the district. Tradition says
that at a remote period a tribe of men, called the Gaulis or Gaulars,
overran and conquered it. At the end of the 17th century it belonged to
the Gond raja of Deogarh. In 1743 it was conquered by the Mahrattas, who
governed it till 1853, when it lapsed to the British government, the
raja of Nagpur having died without an heir."
"BHARAL, the Tatar name for the ""blue sheep"" _Ovis_ (Pseudois) _nahura_,
of Ladak and Tibet. The general colour is blue-grey with black ""points""
and white markings and belly; and the horns of the rams are olive-brown
and nearly smooth, with a characteristic backward curvature. In the
absence of face-glands, as well as in certain other features, the bharal
serves to connect more typical sheep (q.v.) with goats."
"BHARATPUR, or BHURTPORE, a native state of India, in the Rajputana
agency. Its area covers 1982 sq. m. The country is generally level,
about 700 ft. above the sea. Small detached hills, rising to 200 ft. in
height, occur, especially in the northern part. These hills contain good
building stone for ornamental architecture, and in some of them iron ore
is abundant. The Banganga is the only river which flows through the
state. It takes its rise at Manoharpur in the territory of Jaipur, and
flowing eastward passes through the heart of the Bharatpur state, and
joins the Jamna below Agra."
"In 1901 the population was 626,665, a decrease of 2%. The estimated
revenue is £180,000. The maharaja Ram Singh, who succeeded his father in
1893, was deprived of power of government in 1895 on the ground of
intemperate conduct; and in 1900 was finally deposed for the murder of
one of his personal attendants. He was succeeded by his infant son
Kishen Singh. During his minority the administration was undertaken by a
native minister, together with a state council, under the general
superintendence of the political agent. Imperial service cavalry are
maintained. The state is traversed for about 40 m. by the Rajputana
railway."
"The CITY OF BHARATPUR is 34 m. W. of Agra by rail. The population in
1901 was 43,601, showing a decrease of over 23,000 in the decade. The
immense mud ramparts still stand. It has a handsome palace, a new
hospital and a high school. There are special manufactures of _chauris_,
or flappers, with handles of sandalwood, ivory or silver, and tails also
made of strips of ivory or sandalwood as fine as horse-hair."
"BHATGÁON, a town of Nepal, 8 m. from Khatmandu. It is a celebrated place
of Hindu superstition, the favourite residence of the Brahmans of Nepal,
and contains more families of that order than either Khatmandu or Patan.
It has a population of about 30,000, and its palace and buildings
generally are of a more striking appearance than in other Nepalese
towns. The town is said to possess many Sanskrit libraries."
"BHERA, a town of British India, in the Shahpur district of the Punjab,
situated on the river Jhelum. Pop. (1901) 18,680. It is the terminus of
a branch of the North-Western railway. It is an important centre of
trade, with manufactures of cotton goods, metal-work, carving, &c. Bhera
was founded about 1540 on its present site, but it took the place of a
city on the opposite bank of the river, of far greater antiquity, which
was destroyed at this period."

important centre of trade with Rajputana, and has factories for ginning
and pressing cotton, and metal manufactures. Its rise dates from 1817,
when it was made a free market."
"BHOPAL, a native state of India, in the central India agency. Its area
is 6902 sq. m., and its population in 1901 was 665,961, showing a
decrease of 30% in the decade. This seems to be in part due to a
difference in numeration, but the state suffered heavily from famine in
1896-1897 and 1899-1900. Bhopal is the principal Mussulman state in
central India, ranking next to Hyderabad among the Mahommedan states of
India. The surface of the country is uneven, being traversed by the
Vindhya ranges, a peak of which near Raysen is upwards of 2500 ft. above
sea-level. The general inclination of the country is towards the north,
in which direction most of the streams of the state flow, while others,
passing through the Vindhya ranges, flow to the Nerbudda."
"The estimated revenue of the state is £250,000, and the state pays a
subsidy of £13,000 for the Bhopal battalion. Besides the Bhopal
battalion, a regiment of imperial service cavalry is maintained, under
the name of the Victoria Lancers. There is a branch railway from Itarsi
to Bhopal city, continued to Jhansi. The British currency has been
introduced, and in 1897-1898, Rs. 71,00,000 of Bhopali coins were
converted. The residence of the political agent and the headquarters of
the Bhopal battalion are at Sehore, 20 m. west of Bhopal city. The city
of Bhopal, a railway station, had a population in 1901 of 76,561. The
palace, with its rock fortress, is called Fatehgarh. An excellent
water-supply has been provided from two large artificial lakes. There
are two hospitals. There is an export trade in opium."
"BHOPAL AGENCY, an administrative section of central India, takes its
name from the state of Bhopal, which is included in it. The Bhopal
agency is administered by the agent to the governor-general in central
India. Its area is 11,653 sq. m., and its population in 1901 was
1,157,697. It was created in 1818. In 1900 this district suffered
severely from famine owing to the complete failure of the monsoon, and
the cultivated area decreased by 50 or 60%; but, on the whole, trade has
improved of late years owing to the new railways, which have stimulated
commerce and created fresh centres of industry."
"BHOPAWAR, an agency in central India. It consists of the Dhar and
Barwani states, three minor states, Ali Rajpur, Jhabua and Jobat, and a
number of districts and estates. Its total area is 7684 sq. m., and its
population on this area in 1901 was 547,546. But in 1901 and 1904
certain districts were transferred from this agency to the Indore
residency, created in 1899, and the area of Bhopawar was thus reduced by
3283 sq. m. The chief towns are Dhar (pop. 17,792), Barwani (6277) and
Kukshi (5402)."
"BHOR, a native state of India, in the Poona political agency, Bombay,
forming one of the Satara Jagirs; situated among the higher peaks of the
Western Ghats. Its area covers 925 sq. m. The population in 1901 was
137,268, showing a decrease of 12% in the decade; the estimated gross
revenue is £21,437; the tribute, £310. The chief, whose title is _pant
sachiv_, is a Brahman by caste. The town of BHOR is 25 m. south of
Poona. In 1901 the population was 4178. The Bhor Ghat, on the northern
border of the state, has always been the main pass over the Western
Ghats, or means of communication between the sea-coast and the Deccan.
Since 1861 it has been traversed by the main line of the Great Indian
Peninsula railway."
"BHUJ, a town of India, the capital of the native state of Kach, in the
Gujarat division of Bombay, situated at the base of a fortified hill.
Pop. (1901) 26,362. It contains some interesting examples of
architecture of the middle of the 16th century and later; it was a place

"BIAS (from the Fr. _biais_, of unknown origin; the derivation from Lat.
_bifax_, two-faced, is wrong), something oblique or slanting. The term
is used especially of a piece of cloth cut obliquely across the texture,
or of a seam of two such pieces brought together; and in the game of
bowls (q.v.) it is applied alike to the one-sided construction of the
bowl, flattened on one side and protruding on the other, and to the
slanting line the bowl takes when thrown. The figurative sense of the
word, prejudice or undue leaning to one side of a subject, is derived
from this bowling term."
"BIBER, HEINRICH JOHANN FRANZ VON (1644-1704), German violinist and
composer, was for some time musical conductor at Salzburg, and was
ennobled by the emperor Leopold in 1681. He is regarded as the earliest
important German composer for the violin, his works including sonatas
and church music."
"BIBERACH, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Württemberg, on the Riss,
a small affluent of the Danube, 22 m. S.S.W. from Ulm. Pop. (1900) 8390.
It is still surrounded by medieval walls and towers, and is strikingly
picturesque. Its principal church dates from the 12th century, and it
possesses a hospital with rich endowments. Its main industries are
cloth, bell-casting, toys and zinc wares, and its fruit markets are
famous."
"Biberach appears as a village in the 8th century, and in 1312 it became
a free imperial city. During the Thirty Years' War it underwent various
vicissitudes, and was for a while held by the Swedes. In 1707 it was
captured and put to ransom by the French, who afterwards, in 1796 and
1800, defeated the Austrians in the neighbourhood. In 1803 the city was
deprived of its imperial freedom and assigned to Baden, and in 1806 was
transferred to Württemberg. Biberach is the birthplace of the sculptor
Johann Lorenz Natter (1705-1763) and the painter Bernhard Neher
(1806-1886); Christoph Martin Wieland, born in 1733 at the neighbouring
village of Oberholzheim, spent several years in the town."
"BIBIRINE, or BEBEERINE, C19H21NO3, an alkaloid obtained from the bark
and fruit of the greenheart (q.v.) tree, _Nectandra rodiaei_, called
_bibiru_ or _sipiri_ in Guiana, where the tree grows. The substance was
discovered about the year 1835 by Hugh Rodie, a surgeon in Demerara, who
used it as a febrifuge in substitution for quinine."
